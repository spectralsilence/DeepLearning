This repo contains the code and data for Team 7's Deep Learning Final Project

Requirements for the environment are listed in JamesNLPRequirements.txt

The notebooks folder contains the code for the project, as well as in line explanations. 

The data folder contains the data we prepared. This combines the dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset) with images we scraped from imdb. Additionally, we extracted only the relevant information from the kaggle page and restricted entries to those with both text and picture data.

The image file is too big to upload here. It is on our canvas team page at Team Project Group 7 > files > FullImages.zip

The writeup attached to Canvas provides more detail.
